Introduction
    Plan Bouquet Description & Spillbound query inspection based guarantee

2 BACKGROUND
    Notations
        Table of Notations
    Terminologies
        Selectivity vs Cardinality
        Query Predicates (Well-known & Error-Prone)
        [x] ESS (Error Prone Selectivity Space)
        [x] OCS(Optimal Cost Surface)
        [x] POSP (Parametric Optimal Set of Plans)
        Performance Metrics
    Assumption
        Plan Cost Monotonicity & Smoothness
        Axis Parallel Concave
        Axis Parallel Linear
        Bounded Cost Growth
        Perfect Cost Model
        All predicates are considered to be error-prone (Conservative assumption like Selectivity Independence)

3 PROBLEM FORMULATION
    Challenge in the Repeated compilation, even one-time compilation for canned queries on static sized database
    	Computational feasibility of Full space exploration
    	Cons of using low and uniform distribution

4 Approach to problem
    Speeding up the compilation process itself (Issues in Old Design & Exponential NEXUS)
        Cons of low resolution in Uniform Distribution (done for high dimensional queries, will affect both Full Space Exploration & NEXUS)
    Improved Discretization of ESS (Geometric distribution with a proof for relaxed but bounded MSO, guaranteeing computational feasibility)
    Incremental compilation (Extending existing ESS)
        Using Information from previous compilation
            Extending previous contours in Extended ESS with new Geometric distribution
            Obtaining contours in existing ESS
                Algorithms for Creating new contours in existing ESS, using information from past contours in existing ESS
                Getting relaxed MSO bounds, occurred due to using information from previous contours
                Extending incremental algorithm to n-Dimension
        Creating Completing New contours

Experiments

Future work
    Application of Dimensionality Reduction to Incremental Bouquet Maintenance
    Relaxing Selectivity Independence for improving empirical performance of Spillbound
