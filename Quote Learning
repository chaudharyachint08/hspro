Compromise where you can,
But where you can't,
*Don't*

Even if everyone is telling you that,
*Something wrong is something right*

Even if the whole world is telling you to move
*It is your duty to plant yourself like a Tree*

Look them in the eyes and say
*No!! you move*

Just because it is path of least resistance, doesn't mean it is wrong path
*Staying together is more important, than how we stay together*


We have, what we have, when we have it







*“It’s not complicated, it’s just a lot of it.”*
- Richard Feynman

Abstraction & Reasoning is the key, not Differentiation 
to actual AI(Artificial Intelligence), what we have now is 
AI (Augmented Intelligence)
